### **Understanding the Key Technologies**

1. **Phaser**: Phaser is a popular open-source framework for building HTML5 games. It's excellent for 2D games and supports both Canvas and WebGL rendering. You'll be using Phaser to create the game's visual aspects and handle the game logic.
2. **Socket.io**: This is a JavaScript library that enables real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication between web clients and servers. It's perfect for the multiplayer aspect of your game, allowing two players to connect and play in real-time.
3. **Node.js and Express**: You're likely familiar with these for creating the server-side of your application. Node.js is the runtime environment, while Express is the framework to help handle requests and routes.
4. **SQLite**: This is a lightweight database engine. In your game, you might use it for storing game states or player data, though for a simple implementation, it might not be necessary.
